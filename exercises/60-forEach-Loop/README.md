#6 forEach loop

It is possible to traverse an array using the array.forEach function. You have to specify what to do on each iteration of the loop.

//item will be the value of the specific item.
//index will be the item index.
//arr will be the
myArray.forEach(function(item, index, arr){

});


Instructions
Right now, the code is printing all the items in the array. Please change the function code to print only the numbers divisible by 14.
