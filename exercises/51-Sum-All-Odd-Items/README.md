#5.1 Sum odd items

Create a function called sumOdds that sums all the odd numbers in the "arr" list and returns the result.

HINT:
You have to loop the array.
You will need to declare an auxiliar variable outside the loop to keep adding the values.
On each loop, you have to ask if the value of the array in that index position is an odd number. If its odd then add the value to the auxiliar.

Hint: an auxiliar variable is a regular variable, the only difference is a logical difference; an auxiliar variable is like a chosen one, it'll be useful until it completes its purpose (add all the values, make a copy of a value, etc).
