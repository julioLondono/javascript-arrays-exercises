#11 The for loop

Another way to loop an array with the for loop will be using the IN statement like this:

for (var index in myArray){
    console.log(myArray[index]);
}

Instructions
Calculate the average value of all the items in the array and print it on the console.

HINT:
To print the average, you have to add all the values and divide the result by the total length of the array.
