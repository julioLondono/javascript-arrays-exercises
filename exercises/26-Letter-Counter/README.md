Letter Counter
Our customer needs a program that counts the letters repetitions in a given string, I know that's weird, but they are very adamant, We need this asap! 

Instructions:
letters and the values are the number of times it is repeated throughout the string.

Example
console.log(count);

//will print on the console { h: 1, e: 1, l: 2, o: 1 }

Hints:
Ignore white spaces in the string.
you should lower case all letters to have an accurate count of all letters regardless of casing of the letter.
