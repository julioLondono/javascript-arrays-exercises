#1.1 Print the last one

Instructions from your teacher:
You will never know how many items myStupidArray has because it is being randomly generated during runtime.

You know that the property

SOMEARRAY.length

returns the length of SOMEARRAY.

Instructions
Create a variable named theLastOne, and assign it the LAST element of myStupidArray.

Then, print it on the console.
