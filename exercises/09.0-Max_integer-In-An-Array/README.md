#9 Max integer from array

Max integer from array

Write a script that finds the biggest integer in myArray and print that number in the console with the console.log function.

Hint:
Define an auxiliar variable and set the first value to 0, then compare the variables with all the items in the array. Replace the value every time the new element is bigger than the one stored in the auxiliar variable. At the end you will have the biggest number stored in the variable.

Your result should be 5435.
